# Revca Assessment

Created as a part of Revca's frontend assessment. Basically a canvas which you may
draw shapes on, and the coordinates would be printed to the console.

## Approach

I found the most straight-forward way of implementing this is through creating a
`canvas` element on top of an `img` tag.

This provides an easy to reason about api that works on almost anything.

## Preview

This application is deployed on [Github pages](https://osamaadam.github.io/revca-assessment/).

## Development

If you'd like to run this locally, simply clone the repository and run `npm start`.
By default the application would be running at [localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
